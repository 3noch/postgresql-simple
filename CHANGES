Version 0.1:
  * Renamed several modules, typeclasses, and functions:

        QueryParams  (renderParams)   -> ToRow   (toRow)
        QueryResults (convertResults) -> FromRow (fromRow)
        Param  (render)  -> ToField   (toField)
        Result (convert) -> FromField (fromField)

  * Added the Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Ok module
 
  * Changed the return type of `fromField` and `fromRow` from
    `Either SomeException` to `Ok`.  Either doesn't have an instance for
    Alternative,  and an orphaned instance inside of postgresql-simple is a 
    very bad idea.   Also,  Ok returns a list of Exceptions so that you can 
    see all the ways it has failed.

  * Thanks to Ozgun Ataman, the "FromRow" typeclass has been massively 
    improved.  The result is simpler definitions and better compositionality.
    Also, user-defined instances need not be to be concerned about forcing
    the converted results,  as 
     
        instance (Result a, Result b) => QueryResults (a,b) where
            convertResults [fa,fb] [va,vb] = do
                !a <- convert fa va
                !b <- convert fb vb
                return (a,b)
            convertResults fs vs  = convertError fs vs 2

        instance (FromField a, FromField b) => FromRow (a,b) where
            fromRow = (,) <$> field <*> field

  * Added :.,  a pair that allows one to compose "FromRow" instances:
 
        instance (FromRow a, FromRow b) => FromRow (a :. b) where
            fromRow = (:.) <$> fromRow <*> fromRow

  * Moved the contents Field module into the "FromField" module.

  * Removed the `RawResult` type.

  * Added `DefaultIsolationLevel` as a distinct `IsolationLevel` option
